OpenHAB 2.0 Notes:

This plugin has been tested in OpenHAB 2.0 using the OpenHAB 1.x compatibility layer.

You should enable the OpenHAB 1.x compatibility later using the documentation found here http://docs.openhab.org/developers/development/compatibilitylayer.html

Assuming you have enabled the OpenHAB 1.x compatibility layer successfully, configuring the Plum add-on binding is no different than any other binding.

Simply drop the jar file in the addons folder, put the necessary config strings in openhab.cfg and your items file (plum.items if using my example) as per readme.txt
